# Adstxter
Check your selling authorization in ads.txt on any website

Adstxter is a lightweight tool for detecting missing sellers in ads.txt files. It provides a one-click test for the presence of specified sellers. The test is run on a website that is open in an active tab.

Sellers for testing are defined in the input field of the Adstxter window. Entered sellers are saved across browser sessions until replaced or removed.

Adstxter is inactive and not using system resources when its window is not open. This ensures minimal system load and no intrusion into browser usage.

The implementation of the testing follows the IAB Tech Lab's ads.txt specification. 

Checking ads.txt files on subdomains is currently not implemented.
